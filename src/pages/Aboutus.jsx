                <p>
                  Tudawe Children Development Center began as a dream — a safe haven where children who have lost family
                  or support could regain hope, joy, and purpose. For nearly three decades, we've nurtured vulnerable
                  girls with love, shelter, and opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tudawe historical house is located in the beautiful village area. The Tudawe Children Development
                  Center premises gathered around the parental House and Property which has enough space for buildings
                  as well as playgrounds. We have to remember Tudawe Family and other initiators who encourage us to
                  donate this nearly half-arced property for making a better world for children.
